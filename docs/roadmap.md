# Roadmap
In the future, we would like to make it work in environments other than Vue.<br>
Therefore, we will gradually reduce the code that depends on Vue in several phases, and eventually release it as a completely new package.


We also aim to provide functions compliant with [Material 3 - Bottom Sheets](https://m3.material.io/components/bottom-sheets/specs). We plan to incorporate these features as they become available.

## Phase 1
### Version : 5.x
### Date : ~ 2023/11

## Phase 2
#### Version : 6.x
#### Date : 


## Phase 3
#### Version : --
#### Date : 
`@takuma-ru/vue-swipe-modal@6.x` -> `@takuma-ru/web-bottom-sheets@1.0.0` :tada:
